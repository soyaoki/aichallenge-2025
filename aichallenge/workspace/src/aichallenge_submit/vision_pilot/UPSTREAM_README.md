## Free and fully open-source stack for L2 ADAS

[![Watch the Video](/Media/Vision_Pilot_Thumbnail.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16jRW5uB5yv2vV_jAUNkCiqJAamWzTh_y/view)

**This codebase contains a productionizable and safety certifiable implementation of an open-source L2 ADAS system
called Vision Pilot.**

Vision Pilot is designed to be integrated with automotive OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers in series production passenger cars,
and the system can optionally be adopted for transportation and logisitcs use-cases in buses and trucks.

We offer the complete codebase as free and fully open-source, including AI model weights to help democratize access to
this vital technology. Vision Pilot is available under the persmissive Apache 2.0 licence and can freely be used for
both commercial and research purposes.


<img src="/Media/VisionPilot_1.0.png" width="100%">

Vision Pilot is designed to support basic/entry L2 ADAS features for in-lane autonomous driving including the following
features:

- **ACC** - autonomous cruise control
- **FCW** - forward collision warning
- **AEB** - autonomous emergency braking
- **LKAS** - lane keep assist
- **LDW** - lane departure warning
- **ISA** - intelligent speed assist
- **Autopilot** - single-lane hands-free highway autopilot

**Sensor specification:**

Vision Pilot can be run with a single, front-facing, monocular camera with 52 - 55 degree horizontal field-of-view, and
1MP - 2MP resolution.

### Hybrid End-to-End AI Architecture

We utilize a **Hybrid End-to-End AI Architecture** as the core of Vision Pilot in which data is processed in parallel by
perception AI models for safety, and End-to-End AI models for performance.

<img src="/Media/VisionPilot_architecture.png" width="100%">

Specifically, Vision Pilot leverages three open-source AI models developed by the Autoware Foundation, these are:

1. [AutoSpeed](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/auto_speed) - Closest in-path object detection
2. [AutoSteer](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/auto_steer) - Ego path future waypoint detection
3. [AutoDrive](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/auto_drive) - End to End distance/in-path object presence detection
   and road curvature estimation

### No Reliance on High Definition Maps

**Vision Pilot does not require 3D high definition maps** and operates in a 'mapless' mode to follow the road in
real-time.

### Presentation

For more information about Vision Pilot, please view our introductory presentation at
this [link](https://canva.link/qjz6rwp40v7apft)

## Getting Started

There are three ways you can build and run Vision Pilot - we provide example data which you can use for visualization
and evaluation, select from the drop down options below:

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1 - Download and build from source</b></summary>

To get started with the project, download the source code from:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_vision_pilot.git
```

Download ONNX Runtime from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases) page.

Build the project:

```bash
  cd VisionPilot
```

```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
```

```bash
  cmake -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH> ../
```

or with ROS2 support

```bash
  cmake -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH> -DENABLE_ROS2_INTERFACE=ON ../
```

or with the optional Occupancy BEV window (heuristic 3D / bird's-eye panel beside the HUD; default is OFF):

```bash
  cmake -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH> -DENABLE_OCCUPANCY=ON ../
```

```bash
  make
```

This will build the project and create VisionPilot executable inside the build directory.
See `VisionPilot/modules/visualization/README.md` for Occupancy controls (orbit / pan / zoom).

#### Run Vision Pilot on test data and visualize outputs

**OpenLane Dataset:**

To test Vision Pilot using open loop scenario testing, first download the sample data from
the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Sxgz3XHzFD6XtETz1sVFRtDKY3W57QB?usp=sharing) directory.

This directory contains video composed of image data from sequences in the appropriate dataset and vehicle speed data
extracted from the dataset.

Update VisionPilot config files `vision_pilot.conf` inside `config` directory and set:

```
source.mode             = video
```

and `vision_pilot_test.conf` set:

```
source.input_video         = <INPUT_VIDEO_FILE_PATH>
source.input_vehicle_speed = <INPUT_VEHICLE_SPEED_FILE_PATH>
```

to point to the appropriate video file path and vehicle speed file path.

*Note*: When VisionPilot built from source, update config files before the build.

Run VisionPilot from inside `build` directory

```
./VisionPilot
```

#### Build VisionPilot DEB package

To build Debian DEB package for VisionPilot run

```bash
  cpack -G DEB
```

To build Debian DEB package for VisionPilot with CPU support build VisionPilot with

```bash
  cmake -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH> -DGPU=OFF ../
```

```bash
  make
```

```bash
  cpack -G DEB
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2 - Use the pre-built Debian pacakge</b></summary>

### Install from the pre-built Debian package

This method is recommended in case new system installation and cuda dependencies are not installed yet.

Download [VisionPilot](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_vision_pilot.git) prebuilt binary.

Install the .deb package

```bash
  sudo apt install ./VisionPilot-1.0-x86_64.deb
```

Reboot the system, cuda dependencies for VisionPilot installed.

#### Run Vision Pilot on test data and visualize outputs

**OpenLane Dataset:**

To test Vision Pilot using open loop scenario testing, first download the sample data from
the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Sxgz3XHzFD6XtETz1sVFRtDKY3W57QB?usp=sharing) directory.

This directory contains video composed of image data from sequences in the appropriate dataset and vehicle speed data
extracted from the dataset.

Update VisionPilot config files `vision_pilot.conf` set:

```
source.mode             = video
```

and `vision_pilot_test.conf` set:

```
source.input_video         = <INPUT_VIDEO_FILE_PATH>
source.input_vehicle_speed = <INPUT_VEHICLE_SPEED_FILE_PATH>
```

to point to the appropriate video file path and vehicle speed file path.

*Note*: When VisionPilot installed from prebuilt binary update the config files inside:

```
/usr/share/visionpilot/config
```

directory.

Run VisionPilot from the command line

```
VisionPilot
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 3 - Use the Docker container</b></summary>

### Run inside Docker container

To run Vision Pilot inside a Docker container, build the container using the Dockerfiles provided in the docker
directory of the repository.
Docker containers can be built with GPU/CPU support, NO_ROS2/ROS2 support, and optional Occupancy BEV support.

To build the container, go to the docker subdirectory and run the following commands:

Default is GPU support NO ROS2 support

```bash
  ./build.sh --gpu --ros2 
```

to build with CPU support

```bash
  ./build.sh --cpu
```

to enable the optional Occupancy BEV window (pass alongside `--gpu` or `--cpu`):

```bash
  ./build.sh --gpu --occupancy
```

To run the container use the `run.sh` script. For example to run the container with CPU support

```bash
  ./run.sh --cpu
```

or with GPU support and ROS2 support

```bash
  ./run.sh --gpu --ros2
```

*_Note:_* Before building the container update the config files inside: `config` directory.

If building with CPU support update `config/vision_pilot.conf`

```
engine.provider     = cpu
```

and when building with ros2 support update

```
source.mode         = ros2
```

When using video input source update `config/vision_pilot_test.conf`

```
source.input_video         = <INPUT_VIDEO_FILE_PATH>
source.input_vehicle_speed = <INPUT_VEHICLE_SPEED_FILE_PATH>
```

Input directory can be modified in the source by using `run.sh` script switch

```bash
  ./run.sh --gpu --data <HOST_DIR>:<CONTAINER_DIR>
```

*_Note:_* <CONTAINER_DIR> need to be the same as during the container build.

## Running Vision Pilot in a Simulator

We support the CARLA Simulator version 0.9.16 for closed-loop testing of Vision Pilot in a virtual environment

CARLA 0.9.16 with Unreal Engine 4: https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### How to Install CARLA Simulator

1. Download binaries and dependencies following official
   documentation: https://carla-ue5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/#

2. If your GPU has 6GB or less of VRAM then you should please follow the modifications specified
   in https://gist.github.com/xmfcx/a5e32fdecfcd85c6cc9d472ce7a3a98d to run CARLA with lower VRAM requirements using
   docker (tested with RTX3060 laptop version)

### How to run CARLA Simulator with Vision Pilot

Change the file path below to where CARLA is downloaded and run. Make sure to change the `--volume` path to your local
specific directory path.

```sh
  docker run -it --rm \
  --runtime=nvidia \                        # Use NVIDIA runtime for GPU access
  --net=host \                              # Use the host's network stack (helps with networking/performance)
  --env=DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \                  # Pass the host's DISPLAY environment variable (for GUI forwarding)
  --env=NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all \        # Expose all GPUs to the container
  --env=NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all \    # Enable all driver capabilities (graphics, compute, etc.)
  --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \ # Mount X11 UNIX socket to enable GUI apps to display
  --volume="$HOME/Downloads/carla/CARLA_0.9.16/:/home/carla/host-carla" \ 
                                            # CHANGE AS NEEDED: Mount your local CARLA folder into the container
  --workdir="/home/carla/host-carla" \      # Set the working directory to the mounted CARLA folder
  carlasim/carla:0.9.16 \                   # Use the official CARLA Docker image, version 0.9.16
  bash CarlaUE4.sh -nosound                 # Run the CARLA startup script with -nosound flag
```

To run with ROS2 native interface, add `--ros2` at the end

#### Update VisionPilot config

Update `vision_pilot.conf` set `source.mode`

```bash
 source.mode = ros2 
```

and also `vision_pilot_ros2.conf` set `ource.input_camera_topic`

```bash
  source.input_camera_topic = /carla/hero/main_cam/image
```

#### Build VisionPilot

Build VisionPilot with ROS2 support

```bash
  cmake -DONNXRUNTIME_ROOT=<ONNX_RUNTIME_ROOT_PATH> -DENABLE_ROS2_INTERFACE=ON ../
```

#### Build CARLA bridge

Go to Simulation/CARLA/ROS2 directory and build the CARLA ROS2 bridge

```bash
  colcon build
```

#### Run CARLA Bridge

Source the installation directory

```bash
  source ./install/setup.bash
```

```bash
  ros2 launch  carla_bridge_bringup carla_bridge.launch.py host:=<HOST> port:=<PORT>
```

_Note_: If you are running CARLA on a different machine to the one which is running Vision Pilot you need to specify the
host and port parameters. Set the IP address of the machine running CARLA as a host and set the port on which CARLA is
publishing as a port.

#### Run VisionPilot

Go to VisionPilot build directory and run the VisionPilot

```bash
  ./VisionPilot
```

## Running Vision Pilot with your own camera

In order to run Vision Pilot with your own camera, you will need to calibrate your camera and provide the calibraiton
information to the Vision Pilot app - this is important for Vision Pilot to accurately measure the shape of the road and
the distance to objects.

### Calibrate your camera

Please follow the steps in the [calibration guide](/Calibration/) and save the calibration yaml file in
the [Vision Pilot config folder](/VisionPilot/config/) and overwrite the data of
the [H.yaml](/VisionPilot/config/H.yaml) file with your calibraiton file parameters - we suggest you retain a copy of
the original H.yaml parameters so that you can run Vision Pilot on our example data.

## Roadmap

- Support for fusion between front-facing camera and automotive RADAR
- Support for 8MP camera resolution with 120 degree horizontal field-of-view
- Safety Verification and Automotive Standards Compliance (ISO26262, ISO8800)
